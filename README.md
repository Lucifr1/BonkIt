### Abstract

Bonk it! is a 3D co-op game with puzzle and jump 'n' run parts, designed for two players. Each player has one unique tool with numerous abilities. The hammer-player can clear the way, while the grapple-player can get to places that are otherwise beyond reach. Only through teamwork and communication can you arrive at a spaceship, to save the world from a devastating fate.

Get ready for a bonking adventure...
