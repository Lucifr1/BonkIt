First of all thank you for buying this asset! 

There is a prefab of the asset with an animator controller attached to it.
This animator controller is an example of how the animations could be used in a game. 
Please note that this is not meant as a fully functional controller to be used directly in a game project.

All textures are included in PSD format, so you can easily change colors when desired.

I hope you will enjoy the bought asset!
